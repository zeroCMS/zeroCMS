The feature is triggered when readers select any desired text and an icon appears to inform them about the feature + create a unique link when clicked. Masha Readers can simply click the icon, copy the unique URL generated and share it with others. When a MASHA-generated URL is loaded, the selected text is highlighted so that it is seen easily. There are callbacks for onMark, onUnmark and onHashRead (when a MASHA URL is loaded) that makes custom events possible and a WordPress plugin exists for quickly adding this utility.");
